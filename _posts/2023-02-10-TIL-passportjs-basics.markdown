First Entry!!

Today I learned the basics of Passport.JS and followed the [tutorial on implementing Google authentication][passport-google]. Specifically the `passport-google-oidc` npm package. I learned the difference between authentication and authorization.

Hopefully I can apply this knowledge in a future project.
